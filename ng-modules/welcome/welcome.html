        Ya have just been transported back in time ta the 2050's.
        <br><br>
        Ya and yer family are in Cape Canaveral, Earth.
        <br><br>
        Tomorrow ya'll begin yer adventure to Minerville, Europa aboard the SLS Oregon.
        <br><br>
        With only yer rickety jet-rocket to protect you across over 400 million miles of cold, unforgiving space.
        <br><br>
        Will you mine asteroids for fuel and make friends along the trajectory
            or will you succumb to radiation poisoning (aka space-dysentery), starvation, or another danger?
        <br><br>
        Ya'll will need supplies from orbital stations along the way, but times are tough.
        <br><br>
        Hold on ta yer socks, and get ready for the ride of yer life!">
