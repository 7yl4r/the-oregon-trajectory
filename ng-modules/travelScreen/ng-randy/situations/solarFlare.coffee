        story: " You and your crew are running an important experiment that will take another 5 hours to complete, but you’ve received a space weather report warning of an impending proton storm. Proton storms, also known as “solar particle events”, happen when particles emitted by the sun during coronal mass ejects and solar flares are pushed out into space. <br><br>Luckily your spacecraft is equipped with a shielded pod that will protect you from the storm – but your crew isn’t the only thing you have to worry about! Energized protons can damage electronic components, cause software contamination and can even result in unexpected (sometimes called “phantom”) spacecraft commands to be executed. <br><br> It’s probably a smart idea to turn off your equipment and stop your experiment until after the storm passes in a few hours, but your chief science officer believes that you’re on the edge of a breakthrough.",
