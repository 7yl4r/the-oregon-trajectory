        This appears to be the remains of communications satellite.
        The old technology is not much of use to you here, but there is a small amount of fuel on board.

        Plink! The crew falls silent, each wondering if they had imagined the sound. It is the sound of
        an astronaut's nightmare, the metallic ping as something...
        Clank! This time it was unmistakable, something has just struck your ship's hull.
        High velocity collisions can slice through ship hulls like butter.
        You have gotten very lucky this time though, it seems. The crew remains on edge for the next hour,
        but further inspection shows no damage to your ship.
