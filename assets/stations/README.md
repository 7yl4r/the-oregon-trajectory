# stations / locations spec
Each directory corresponds to a single location/station.

## spriteSpec.js
This file defines the specifications of the sprite including the location sheet src, the size of each frame and the number of frames.

## sprite sheet
The sheet image used can be anywhere (as specified by spriteSpec.sheet), but is customarily called sheet.png.

### dimensions
Station sprites should be 400px on their largest side. Further scaling can be done using the sprite class & spriteSpec.dimensions.
